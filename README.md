# ATTA Biogeochemistry

This repository contains datasets collected as part of the NSF collaborative project [Quantifying the footprint of a dominant organism: Biogeochemical impacts of leaf cutter ants in a lowland tropical forest ecosystem](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1442568) or ATTA for short. A complimentary RAPID project [ENSO and tropical rainforest soil carbon (CH4, CO2) fluxes](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1624623) was conducted on the same system with a focus on CH4 emissions from soils.
