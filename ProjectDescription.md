## Background 

This is a study of leaf cutter ant (LCA) ecosystem engineering and its legacy effects. We hypothesized that leaf cutter ants *Atta cephalotes* significantly alter soil physical properties and biogeochemical cycles in a wet tropical forest ecosystem in Costa Rica. To quantify the role leaf cutter ants play in mediating ecosystem processes in a tropical forest ecosystem, we:

* Characterized C dynamics on LCA nests and differentiate the sources of CO2 efflux between the activities of ants, fungi, the nest microbial community, and roots and hyphae

* Quantified N, and P biogeochemistry of LCA nests and determine their legacy effects after nests are abandoned 

* Incorporated LCAâ€™s impact on biogeochemical cycling (objectives I and II) into a coupled soil moisture, temperature, and biogeochemistry model to estimate the influence of LCA nests on CO2 fluxes at the ecosystem scale 

* ATTA RAPID complimented the ATTA project and examined whether soil moisture (changes associated with the El Nino) drove soil gas dynamics, focusing on CH4 specifically.
