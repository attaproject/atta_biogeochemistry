# Project Description

This file provides an overview of the ATTA project. 

## Background 

This is a study of leaf cutter ant (LCA) ecosystem engineering and its legacy effects. We hypothesized that leaf cutter ants *Atta cephalotes* significantly alter soil physical properties and biogeochemical cycles in a wet tropical forest ecosystem in Costa Rica. To quantify the role leaf cutter ants play in mediating ecosystem processes in a tropical forest ecosystem, we:

* Characterized C dynamics on LCA nests and differentiate the sources of CO2 efflux between the activities of ants, fungi, the nest microbial community, and roots and hyphae

* Quantified N, and P biogeochemistry of LCA nests and determine their legacy effects after nests are abandoned 

* Incorporated LCA’s impact on biogeochemical cycling (objectives I and II) into a coupled soil moisture, temperature, and biogeochemistry model to estimate the influence of LCA nests on CO2 fluxes at the ecosystem scale 

* ATTA RAPID complimented the ATTA project and examined whether soil moisture (changes associated with the El Nino) drove soil gas dynamics, focusing on CH4 specifically. 

## Study Site

The study was conducted at La Selva Biological Station, a lowland tropical rainforest reserve located at the base of the Cordillera Central in north-eastern Costa Rica (10°25'53.14''N, 84°0'10.51'' W). La Selva Biological Station encompasses over 1600 hectares of old-growth, secondary and plantation style forest and ranges in elevation from 35 to 130 masl. Average annual precipitation is around 4350mm, with less precipitation in the period January to April [documented datasets 1963-2016, OTS website](https://anetium.ots.ac.cr/meteoro/default.php?pestacion=1). The long-term average temperature between 1992 and 2016 was 25.1 °C [documented datasets 1963-2016, OTS website](https://anetium.ots.ac.cr/meteoro/default.php?pestacion=1).

## Experimental Design

In August 2014, we selected A. cephalotes well established nests similar in size (approximately 25 x 25 m soil surface footprint) on alluvial (3 nests) and residual (6 nests) soils, with 3 nests located on residual soils in the primary forest and 3 nests on residual soils in the secondary forest. Each nest plot was paired with a non-nest control plot at least 25m away from the focal nest, on a location with a similar aspect, slope, and vegetation. 

This results in a total of 18 plots (9 controls and 9 nests). Datasets follow the naming conventions shown below and generally contain one or more of the grouping variables such as SiteID, N or C and replicate number.

|Soil type|Forest type|SiteID|Nest or Control|Replicates|PlotID examples|
|---------|-----------|------|---------------|----------|---------------|
|Alluvial |Primary    |ALP   |N or C         |1 to 3    |ALPN1, ALPC2   |
|Residual |Primary    |REP   |N or C         |1 to 3    |REPN2, REPC3   |
|Residual |Secondary  |RES   |N or C         |1 to 3    |RESN1, RESC3   |

Centered on the nest a rectangular plot measuring 6 by 5 meters divided in 1 by 1 m grid cells was established. Three gas wells were installed near the center of the plot at depths of 20, 60 and 100 cm to access soil gas on all replicates. Lysimeters were installed at the same depths for soil water sampling. A central strip of the grid was reserved to access the instrumentation while access to other cells was avoided as much as possible. To assess carbon inputs from vegetation we located two 50 by 50 litter traps on opposite corners of the plots. Two 50 by 50 cm ground traps located on remaining corners were used to sample coarse woody debris. Control plots follow the same lay-out with the exception that the third replicate did not have lysimeters installed.

One plot pair (ALPN1 and ALPC1) had a so called Soil Ecological Observatory located in the center of the plot. This consists of an array of sensors monitoring a soil profile (VWC, T, EC, O2 and CO2) and an automated mini rhizotron (AMR) for continuous monitoring of root and hyphae growth. These SEOs were installed February 2015. Two more (NN2 and NN3) were installed February 2016 on two leaf-cutter nests which were not part of the original plots. 

In XX 201X the RAPID project was initiated on a subset of the studied plots to evaluate soil CH4 emissions in relation to changing soil volumetric water content. On four nest sites and their paired control 4 twenty cm. diameter soil respiration collars were installed. These were used to sample CH4 and CO2 fluxes at bi-monthly intervals. Soil  temperature and water content were measured and top soil samples were collected for characterization of the soil microbiome. 

Mention whatever data we have that does not follow plot layout (I’m thinking density survey in particular) and refer to readme.md with the data for details.

## Datasets

The project repository contains a number of discrete and continuous datasets. Each lives in its own folder with detailed metadata in associated README files.

* [Soil pH](https://github.com/attaproject/atta_biogeochemistry/blob/master/soil_ph)
* [Soil Ecological Observatory](https://github.com/attaproject/atta_biogeochemistry/blob/master/soil_ecological_observatory): soil water content, temperature, and soil electrical conductivity as well as CO2 and O2 profiles for selected nests and a single control site
* Soil lysimeter
